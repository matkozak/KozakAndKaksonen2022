# ImageJ macros

This repository holds my personal ImageJ macros.

To install: move the contents of `macros` into Fiji `macros` folder.
`installMacros.ijm` will load `StartupMacros.ijm` on startup.
There is no need to overwrite `StartupMacros.fiji.ijm`, which holds
the default set of startup macros.

`nvim` folder contains the vim syntax highlighting from 
[Kota Miura](https://github.com/miura/ImageJMacro_Highlighter).
It goes into `~/.config`.
