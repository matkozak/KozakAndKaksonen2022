# frapr

A collection of R scripts for averaging and normalizing FRAP data.

This code is fairly old and full of rookie mistakes, but it works. Assumes that
each numbered script will be ran sequentially, and that all data for a single
experiment are in one folder. Loads files named `experiment ID_patch.txt`,
`experiment ID_cell.txt`, `experiment ID_background.txt` and assumes these are
respectively the bleached ROI, the photobleaching correction ROI and the
background correction ROI. Follows the classic normalization procedure and fit
as described in Phair, R. D., Gorski, S. A., & Misteli, T. (2004). Measurement
of dynamic protein binding to chromatin in vivo, using photobleaching
microscopy. *Methods in Enzymology*, 375, 393â€“414.
